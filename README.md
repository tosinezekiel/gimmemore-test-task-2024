# Developer test task

### Instructions

When working on the task, please fork this repository. When finished with the task please open a PR. 
You are free to use any framework, tool, library as long as using it satisfies two conditions:
1. Using such tool is in compliance with its licence
2. Underlying technology is relevant to the job requirements listed, i.e. solutions using java/c++/asm/etc won't be considered. We do (primarily) PHP and JS, we expect it from you too. _We don't expect PHP knowledge from a Frontend Developer, but you'll get bonus points for knowing any 'backend' language_

Spend as much effort as you see fit on the task. We don't expect you to provide e2e-tested, WCAG-compliant, PWA-ready, containerized multi-threaded  solution, but tests and thought-through UI will get you bonus points for sure.
There will be a code review upon completion, where you will have a chance to present your solution and ask/answer questions.

This is a non-paid test, therefore you're not expected to put crazy hours into solving it. You shouldn't spend more than a couple of hours spanned across 3 days, but please do communicate if you need more time.
Although task is not mandatory, you are encouraged to complete it as **it will** make it easier to integrate you into the team, should we proceed with you.

### Task details
We'll be creating a book club-like service, where authenticated user can add a book they're reading (incl. genre and a size in pages), and add a series of data in form of "Today I read N pages of X". 
User's profile should display info about current progress, and a history of read books. 
Upon completion of the book user should be able to rate the book, leave a review and share the review in social media. 

Bonus points are given for:
1. Good UI and UX
2. Accessibility
3. Aggregation and analytics based on user's data e.g. "2023 these are your 5 top-rated books", or "This month you've read 750 pages with most pages read on Tuesday each week". 
4. Tests
5. Using current industry-standard-tools properly. Ideal project is done using VueJS, Symfony and RDBMS of your choice.
6. Good documentation
